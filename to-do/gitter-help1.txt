@NeelDVirus You could also do something like window.setTimeout(scrolling.funcInEvent1.bind(scrolling), 300);, this will bind the passed function's this to be the current value of scrolling.

@NeelDVirus setTimeout will call your function with undefined as this, which is replaced by window, the global object. The scrolling context is only preserved if you call it like scrolling.funcInEvent1()

bind always binds the this, and also can do partial application. I once wanted partial application without binding this, had to write my own functionccdd .
