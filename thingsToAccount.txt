2. using em in media queries have some quirks regarding using both min-width and max width in the some code block. check this out https://engageinteractive.co.uk/blog/em-vs-rem-vs-px

3.how many decimal points to be used with em in media query

4. Shall i add/remove class of third party using jquery or native css?

5. how to make the width of all the <li> elements same as the size of the longest-width <li> element. 
Ex: in navbar width of <li>blog</li> is small. needed to be equal

6. device a plan to use this for further user experience efficiency
        media only screen and (orientation: portrait) and (min-width: 960px)

7. reliable way of using implmenting background-images with media query concerning that the non-required images dont get downloaded when viewed from large screen size (for example: >1300 in the code below )

            .banner {
                height: 100vh;
                background-image: url("../images/banner/01mobile/banner360-640.jpg");
                background-size: cover;
            }
            @media only screen and (min-width: 320px) {
              .banner{background-image: url("../images/banner/01mobile/banner576-1024.jpg");}
            }
            @media only screen and (min-width: 700px) {
              .banner{background-image: url("../images/banner/03desktop/banner760-1024.jpg");}

            }
            @media only screen and (min-width: 1300px) {
              .banner{background-image: url("../images/banner/03desktop/banner1366-768.jpg");}
            }
